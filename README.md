# Airphonic

### **Project Summary: Airphonic â€“ Sonifying Air Quality**  

**Airphonic** is an interactive web-based application that transforms **real-time air quality data** into **dynamic musical compositions**. By using **data sonification**, the project maps **multiple pollutants** to various **musical parameters** such as pitch, tempo, and harmony.  

- **Harmonious and pleasant sounds** indicate **clean air**.  
- **Dissonant or distorted sounds** reflect **higher pollution levels**.  
- The application features **custom timbres and mood settings** based on **Hong Kong and Bangkok** air quality data.  

### **Technical Overview**  
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, p5.js, Tone.js for interactive visuals & music generation.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Fetch API to retrieve air quality data from **OpenAQ**.  
- **Deployment:**  
  - **Frontend** on **GitHub Pages**  
  - **Backend** on **Render (Node.js API proxy for OpenAQ)**  

### **Exhibition & User Interaction**  
- Users can **select different locations** and hear how air pollution affects sound.  
- **Real-time sonification** makes air quality **tangible and engaging**.  
- Future plans include **interactive elements** where users can "clean" the air through movement or sound input.
